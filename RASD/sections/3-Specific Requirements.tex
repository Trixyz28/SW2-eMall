\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The eMall program consists in a mobile application compatible with the iOS and the Android operative systems. The application is designed to be used by both Drivers and Operators, and the user interface of the application is supposed to be simple to understand (e.g. functionalities can be accessed through clicking on common icons) and user-friendly, in order to maximize the usability and the user experience.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The hardware interface required to access to the eMall system is a working device (a mobile phone or a tablet) with internet connection that can successfully install the application. It must have fundamental sensors such as GPS and Bluetooth: the first is used for determining the location of the User and the second for the connection between the vehicle and the driver’s device.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The application makes use of an external API for geo-localisation. It provides a map for Drivers to identify their actual position and the charging stations nearby, making the interaction more explicit. In addition to this, it uses the Bluetooth API to connect to the Driver's vehicle in order to retrieve useful data for the system. 
\\
\\
For what concerns the server side of the application, the system requires the implementation of a DBMS to store the data.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
Many functionalities offered by the system relies on the communication with other services. Thanks to external APIs, e-Mall employs different interfaces: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Retrieval of data of a charging station}\\
    The interface is able to respond with an overview on the status a specific charging station, this is retrieved through the charging station's unique identification number. 
    \item \textbf{Retrieval of data on DSOs}\\
    The interface is able to retrieve a list of available DSOs with the information they published. In this way the operators can acquire energy from any of them for the selected charging station. 
    \item \textbf{Retrieval of map information}\\
    The eMall system provides a map for users to visualise their actual position and the available charging stations near them. In this case we need to interface with an external API which offers map and geolocation services. 
    \item \textbf{Retrieval of vehicle data}\\
    The interface is able to retrieve relevant information about the user's actual guiding vehicle, such as its battery status. This is also made possible with an external API. 
    
\end{itemize}

The device on which the application runs can be a smartphone or a tablet (NR8). It must be able to connect to Internet (NR10) and it must have the required sensors, in particular GPS and Bluetooth (NR9) for the correct working of the application.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system should be highly reliable, and running without failure most of the time. If failures happen, it should be able to recover quickly (NR3). To achieve this, regular maintenance should be done.
\\
Since the system relies also on several external API which do not depend on our system, it must not completely fail when one of those fail. 

\subsubsection{Availability}
The aimed availability for the system is 99\%: in fact, the system must be available and running most of the time, especially during the business hours (NR2, NR3, NR4), although it is not a big issue for the system to have some short downtime. In the case that a Driver should book for a charge, if he is not in a rush, he can simply do it later. If the system is down while the driver is charging, he can complete the charging process and pay for the service later. 

\subsubsection{Security}
The information that the system is handling can be either public or sensitive. The latest need to be protected (NR11, NR12, NR13, NR14, NR15). To do so, the system can make use of different approaches such as limiting the access by setting different authorisation level so that unauthorised users are denied to access. In the case of password, it is possible to scramble it through encryption algorithm, so that it is unreadable by unauthorised ones.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system should be easily modifiable for future improvement and adaptation to the evolving requirements or changes in the environment (NR16). In order to achieve this, it is important to keep in line the document while realizing the application. Moreover, it is fundamental to re-use design patterns which helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and to improve code readability.


\subsubsection{Portability}
The eMall application should be installed on a device to be used. The User interface and functionalities of the system should work well on different screen sizes of different devices, mobile phone or tablet, with different operating systems such as iOS, Android and HarmonyOS (NR7, NR8).
