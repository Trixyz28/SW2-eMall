\subsection{Generated model}
It is shown below a simple scenario, where a charging process is presented. In this instance there are 3 users: 1 driver and 2 operators. The vehicle of the driver is charged at a charging station after reservation. An offer is also applied on the charging. The two operators work for the same CPO, which manage the charging station.

Moreover, this instance satisfies all the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every vehicle has a driver
    \item Every socket has a charging station
    \item All identifiers are unique
    \item Every charging process has a reservation
    \item Every charging station has at least an operator
\end{itemize}
