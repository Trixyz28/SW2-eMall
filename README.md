# eMall - e-Mobility for All

## Introduction
This project focuses on the problem of electric mobility (e-Mobility), which is a way to limit the carbon footprint caused by our urban and sub-urban mobility needs. When using an electric vehicle, knowing where to charge the vehicle and carefully planning the charging process in such a way that it introduces minimal interference and constraints on our daily schedule is of paramount importance. 

To facilitate the use of electric vehicles, we design the **eMall** (e-Mobility for All) system to coordinate all the activities that the charging process would require. In this way, the various figures involved in the procedure have been connected:
- *e-Mobility Service Providers* aim to help drivers in planning and completing the charging process.
- *Charging Point Operators* manage the charging stations, and acquire energy from *Distribution System Operators*.

## Requirement Analysis
In the first phase, the **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document** (RASD) is produced. It contains the description of the scenarios, the use cases that describe them, and the models describing the requirements and specification for the 
problem under consideration.

The final version of RASD is reported [here](DeliveryFolder/RASD%20V1.2.pdf).


## System Design
The **Design Document** (DD) contains a functional description of the system, focusing on architectural aspects and user interfaces. It is considered the basis for the practical development of the system, and it also includes a plan for implementation, integration and testing activities. 

The final version of DD is reported [here](DeliveryFolder/DD%20V1.1.pdf).
